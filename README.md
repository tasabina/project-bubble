# Game Jam 2025 Project

## Uploading an HTML game to itch.io

### Step 1: Prepare Your Game Files
1. Ensure your game works offline:

- Your HTML game should run locally from a browser. Test it by opening the index.html file directly in a browser.
- All necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) should be included and properly linked.
1. Organize your files:

- Place all your game files in a single folder.
- Avoid spaces or special characters in file and folder names to prevent compatibility issues.

1.Compress the files into a ZIP:

- Select all your game files (not the folder itself).
- Compress them into a .zip file. The main index.html should be at the root level of the ZIP, not inside a subfolder.
### Step 2: Start a New Project
1. Log in to your itch.io account.
1. Click your profile icon in the top-right corner and select "Dashboard".
1. Click "Create new project".

### Step 5: Upload Your Game

1. Set the index.html file as the default starting point if prompted.

### Step 6: Configure Display Options
